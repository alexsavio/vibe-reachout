## [Unreleased]

### 💼 Other

- Initial commit from Specify template
- Implement Telegram permission hook for Claude Code (#1)

* Implement vibe-reachout: Telegram permission hook for Claude Code

Rust CLI that intercepts Claude Code PermissionRequest events and forwards
them to Telegram, letting the user approve/deny/reply from their phone
instead of staying at the terminal.

Includes full spec, design artifacts, and implementation:
- Hook mode (stdin JSON -> Unix socket -> stdout JSON)
- Bot mode (Unix socket server + Telegram long polling)
- Install command (registers hook in ~/.claude/settings.json)
- Support for Allow, Deny, Reply (free-text), Always Allow, Timeout
- Multi-chat delivery (all authorized chat IDs, first response wins)
- Security validation (only authorized chat IDs accepted)
- Graceful fallback (bot down or timeout -> terminal prompt)
- 4MB release binary with rustls TLS backend

* Add test suite: 44 tests covering models, formatter, keyboard, config, install, and IPC

- Add tempfile dev-dependency for filesystem-based tests
- Extract Config::load_from_path and install_hook for testability
- Create src/lib.rs exposing modules needed by integration tests
- Unit tests for HookOutput constructors, Decision serde, HookInput deserialization
- Unit tests for formatter (all tool types, truncation, format_size)
- Unit tests for keyboard (button counts, callback data format)
- Unit tests for config (validation, socket path, defaults)
- Unit tests for install (idempotency, preserving existing hooks)
- Integration tests for IPC client-server roundtrip over Unix socket

* Upgrade deps (teloxide 0.17, toml 0.9, dirs 6) and bump MSRV to 1.93

- teloxide 0.13 → 0.17: fix answer_callback_query to take owned CallbackQueryId
- toml 0.8 → 0.9.8, dirs 5 → 6.0.0
- Bump rust-version to 1.93 (required by transitive dep time 0.3.47)
- Fix collapsible-if clippy warning in config.rs
- Resolves cargo audit RUSTSEC-2026-0009 (time crate DoS)

* chore: add MIT license, changelog, and switch to CalVer 2026.2.0

- Add MIT LICENSE file
- Update README with Rust 1.93+ requirement and license link
- Switch version scheme to CalVer (YYYY.MM.PATCH)
- Add emoji prefixes to cliff.toml commit groups (matching cor-cli)
- Generate initial CHANGELOG.md via git-cliff
